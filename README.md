# Soccer
This repository the Capstone project for my COMP335 - Web Application Development - course at Bridgewater State University.

This project aims to deliver soccer tournament standings, upcoming games, and news to users. 

This project works in 2 ways: 

    1) Users who don't have an account will be limited to the main page where they will see standings, news, and upcoming games for random tournaments.
    2) Users who sign up will have a main page tailored to their preferred tournament such as standings, news and upcoming games for their preferred team.

I hope you enjoy this preliminary project.
